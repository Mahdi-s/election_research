    "The practice of gerrymandering, or the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for political gain, has long been a contentious issue in democratic governance. This Notebook builds upon the foundational concepts laid out in \"An Impossibility Theorem for Gerrymandering\" by Alexeev and Mixon, refining the established formula to enhance the analysis of electoral districting. Our research develops a sophisticated simulation model to evaluate the implications of various districting strategies on electoral fairness.\n",
